TXST: 3358 Data Structures and Algorithms-Assignment 5pt2.
Grade:98% (Points lost on not decrementing numItems in pop() function)

Assignment Description:
You are to study and complete this supplied partial program that does the following:
●	Use the STL stack template class to develop a custom queue class (named cnPtrQueue).
  ○	The cnPtrQueue has member variable numItems (that keeps track of the number of items in the queue), which should be helpful for implementing the member function size() (for inspecting the number of items in the queue). 
●	Use the cnPtrQueue to perform a breadth-first (level) traversal of a linked list of linked lists data structure and process (print) the data items stored in the structure.
